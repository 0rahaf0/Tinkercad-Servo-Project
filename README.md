# Tinkercad-Servo-Project
This project simulates six servo motors and a potentiometer using Tinkercad and Arduino. One servo is controlled by the potentiometer for manual adjustment, while the other five perform continuous sweeps. The repository includes Arduino code, wiring diagrams, and instructions to recreate the setup in Tinkercad.
